# dotfiles
These are my dot files for vim, i3, zsh and git.

in order for having the color mode working the color.lua file needs to in the the plugin directory:

```
~/.config/nvim
|-- after/
|-- ftplugin/
|-- lua/
|-- plugin/
|-- syntax/
|-- init.vim
```

if it s located there it will be initialized by nvim automatically.


color.sh shall be place in the path so that it can be called from the terminal.
